# TicTacToe
This was an earlier project in my programming in java class at college. It simulates a game of tic tac toe that can be played
between two players as many times as desired. This was before we were taught classes so everything is executed in one class.
Although it appears cluster due to the lack of other classes, all the formatting and way I decided to code it was my choice and 
my style.
